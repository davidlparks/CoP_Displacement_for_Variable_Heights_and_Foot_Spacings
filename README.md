This project measures the biomechanical effects of landing from variable heights and foot spacings with a focus on CoP displacement and hip abductor/adductor muscle activation. One recreationally active male (age: 39 years, height: 190.5cm, body mass: 93.9kg) was asked to perform a step-off landing from two heights (30.48cm and 60.96cm) while using three different foot spacings (20cm, 40cm, and 60cm). Three trials were performed for each landing height/foot spacing combination. The subject wore 14 lower-body markers while kinematic data were collected at 100 Hz. Two in-ground force plates recorded kinetic data and two EMG sensors placed on the right hip abductor and adductor muscles collected data at 1000 Hz. The EMG data were rectified prior to analysis using 4th order zero-lag band-pass Butterworth filters with cut-off coefficients of 10 Hz and 400 Hz. Only data from the right leg were analyzed.
